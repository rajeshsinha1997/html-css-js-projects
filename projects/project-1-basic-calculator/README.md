# 🧮 Basic Calculator

A simple, clean, and stylish calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project helps reinforce foundational front-end skills, especially working with layout techniques and responsive design.

## 🚀 Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Clear (`AC`), delete (`DEL`), and evaluate (`=`)
- Button-based input (no keyboard handling)
- Responsive layout with adaptive button grid
- Aesthetic dark theme with glowing button shadows
